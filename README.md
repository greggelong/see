## a place to put some C code

Now I see why you need gitignore!

I haven't really had compiled and executable files

in the same directory as I was using python and javaScript

but you really need that gitignore if you are compiling.

making all the .o and .exe 


## setting up vs code on windows 10 

had some trouble setting up vs code to compile and run

c programs.

I had already downloaded codeblocks and could easily compile

as well as being able to compile and run in the linux sub system

But I was not able to get vs code to find the path to codeblocks compiler.

so in the end I had to install minGW and add the path 

I followed instructions from vscode help.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

and it actually worked.

this video was also helpful

to walking through the configure process

## Cloned onto my raspberry pi

I wanted to also use my raspberry pi.

However my pi has very limited memory and I wanted to work off

the usb drive I am using for downloads.

However I could not change the permissions to executable

with chmod +x  

it seems my pi usb is fat format

I will need to format a different drive 

or mount this one differently
