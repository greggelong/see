## a place to put some C code

Now I see why you need gitignore!

I haven't really had compiled and executable files

in the same directory as I was using python and javaScript

but you really need that gitignore if you are compiling.

making all the .o and .exe 


## setting up vs code on windows 10 

had some trouble setting up vs code to compile and run

c programs.

I had already downloaded codeblocks and could easily compile

as well as being able to compile and run in the linux sub system

But I was not able to get vs code to find the path to codeblocks compiler.

so in the end I had to install minGW and add the path 

I followed instructions from vscode help.

and it actually worked.

this video was also helpful
